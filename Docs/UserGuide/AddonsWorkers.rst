Add-ons, also referred to as archivers are independent modules that
handle various archive types. Add-ons are named "ark_zip",
"ark_tar" etc. Additional add-ons maybe written to support more
archive formats.

Of course, for these new archive formats, you'll need to have the
corresponding command-line programs that physically manipulate the
archives installed as well.
