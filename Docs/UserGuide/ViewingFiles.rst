Viewing Files
=============


Beezer allows you to view files in an archive (without extracting the
entire archive) using the program (as configured in the *FileTypes*
preferences) that can open that file. For example, view image files
using an image viewing application, view text files using a text
editor and so on....

To view files you must select one or more files, and do one of the
following actions:

   -  Choose Actions –> View, or
   -  Press toolbar: View, or
   -  Use the :ref:`context menu <ArchiveWindow:Context Menu>`'s View
      command, or
   -  press the **ENTER** on the selection, or
   -  double-click the selected files

Because you are allowed to view several files simultaneously, Beezer
warns and confirms when you try to open more than 10 files
simultaneously. If the selection contains folders, they won't be
checked out for viewing.

Open With
=========

   The View files command automatically launches the default application
   for the file you are trying to view. But sometimes, you might want to
   view the file with some other application other than the one that is
   associated with it. Also, if the archive has incorrect permissions,
   viewing the files may not actually cause it to be viewed. In such
   cases you can use the Open With command to choose the application you
   wish to view the files with.

   You can Open With by any of the following methods:

   -  Choose Actions –> Open With
   -  Use the :ref:`context menu <ArchiveWindow:Context Menu>`'s Open
      With command

   Once you select the Open With command, Beezer extracts the files and
   asks *Tracker* to allow you to choose which application to view the
   file with.

**Note:** The View/Open With commands gives you only a temporary copy of the file.
As soon as you close the archive the temporary files will be automatically deleted.
