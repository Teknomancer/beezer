Lha AddOn
=========


The lha (lzh) archiver gives you the following options:

**Header Level**

   Allows you to specify the amount of compression for the LHA header
   bytes. 0 is fastest but is poor compression, 2 is maximum compression
   but slower. The setting 2 should be fast on all modern systems.

**Other options**

   -  **LHarc compatible format**: Select this option if you want the
      archive to be compatible with the old LHarc tool.

For information on saving these settings to the archive or as defaults
read the :ref:`ArchiveWindow:\< archiver \>` menu information.
