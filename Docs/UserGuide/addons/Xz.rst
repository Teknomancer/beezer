The xz archiver gives you the following options:

**Compression Level**

   Allows you to specify the amount of compression while creating
   archives on a scale of 1 to 9. 9 is maximum compression, 1 is minimum
   compression. Compression levels greater than 6 should only be used on
   sufficiently powerful machines.

For information on saving these settings to the archive or as defaults
read the :ref:`ArchiveWindow:\< archiver \>` menu information.
