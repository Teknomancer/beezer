Creating Folders
================


You can create directories (folders) anywhere in an archive. You must
choose where to create the new folder similar to how you choose where
to :doc:`add files <AddingFiles>`.

Once you have chosen where to create the new folder, choose Actions
â€“> Create Folder.

You will be asked to enter the name of the new folder. The Create
Folder window also shows you where the new folder will be added.
":Root:" indicates that the new folder will be added to the root of
the archive. Once you type-in the name of the new folder, press the
Create button.

A status window will be shown until the operation is complete.
