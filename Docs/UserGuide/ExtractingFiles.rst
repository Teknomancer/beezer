Extracting Files
================


Extracting the contents of the archive can be done through any of the
following ways:

   -  Choosing Actions –> Extract extracts the entire archive to the
      default extract folder. If no default extract folder is specified,
      Beezer prompts you to choose a destination folder. You can specify
      a default extraction folder in
      :ref:`Preferences <Preferences:Paths>`. The sub-menu displays
      various probable extract destinations, clicking them starts
      extraction immediately without any further prompts
   -  Choosing Actions –> Extract To always prompts for a destination
      folder whether a default extract folder is specified or not.
      Sub-menu displays various probable extract destinations, clicking
      them starts extraction immediately without any further prompts
   -  Choosing Actions –> Extract Selected does the same as Extract To,
      but for selected entries
   -  Choosing toolbar: Extract. This always extracts the entire archive
      and not selected entries. Clicking on it extracts the entire
      archive to the default extract location or prompts you for a
      destination folder. The context portion provides some probable
      extract locations

Drag 'n Drop
============

   You can extract entries through drag and dropping them on to a
   *Tracker* window.

   Drag 'n drop extraction always extracts selected entries. If you want
   to extract the entire archive through drag 'n drop, just choose Edit
   –> Select All and then drag 'n drop the selection.

   While dragging entries to be extracted, the number of files and
   folders that will be extracted will be shown. But since extraction is
   a hierarchial action, parent folders that aren't selected while
   dragging aren't counted and displayed although they will be
   extracted.

Please also see :doc:`ViewingFiles` for information on
how you can view files in an archive.

**Note:** Currently Beezer does NOT report any errors that occur while
extracting archives. This may be changed in future versions.
