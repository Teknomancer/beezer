Editing Comments
================


Some archivers supports comments, for example, the zip archiver
supports zipfile comments. To edit the comments of the archive, click
Actions â€“> Comments.

You will see a Comments window which has an editable textarea with
the archive's comments. Here you can modify the comments. Press
"Save" button to save the modified comment to the archive. Pressing
"Cancel" simply discards any change you made.

To remove comments from the archive, simply delete the existing
comment and press "Save".

By default, if an archive with comments are opened they are
immediately shown in the Comments window. You can turn off this
behaviour of displaying comments from the
:ref:`Preferences: Miscellaneous <Preferences:Miscellaneous>`.
