Introduction
============


Thank you for using Beezer!

This introduction section is for you newbies or the type who actually
read documentation before trying out the app.

Beezer is a *WinZip* style utility for Haiku (and compatible
operating systems) written totally from scratch originally for the
BeOS. It's a versatile, add-on based archiving utility designed to
support most of the common archive formats such as zip, tar, gzip
etc. It's a graphical front-end that tries to make working with
archives as easy as possible.

It's a heavily multi-threaded application providing a high level of
responsiveness, the pros and cons of this aspect is discussed in
other parts of this documentation. Beezer has gone through some
stressful tests on a range of different computer configurations and
should mostly be stable on any system that meets its
:doc:`requirements <Requirements>`

For all you curious types, and for those who asked me this at
*BeShare* - Beezer means "large and impressive" according to The
Webster, Indian edition dictionary :^)

I hope you enjoy using Beezer as much as I enjoyed writing it. I work
hard to make it as polished and error-free as possible, but due to
the complex nature of this project, I'm not in a position to
guarantee the quality of Beezer. It's free software, use at your own
risk!
