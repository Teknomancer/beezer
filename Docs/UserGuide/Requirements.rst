To use Beezer your system must meet the following requirements:

   -  Intel or compatible machine, PowerPC is not yet supported
   -  Haiku or compatible OS
   -  Command-line apps like *zip*, *unzip*, *gzip*, etc. (these usually
      ship with the OS themselves)
   -  A BFS volume with 5 MB for the program, more free space for
      working with archives\*
   -  64 MB or more of RAM - the more the RAM the better.

\* Some operations, such as addition of files to the archive, may
require making copies of files or folders. For this you will need
sufficient amount of free space on your hard-disk (BFS volume).
