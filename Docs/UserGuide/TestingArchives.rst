Testing Archives
================


Testing archives is a process of determining if the content of the
archive is flawless. Some archive formats do not support testing.

After selecting the testing action, the archive will immediately be
tested for errors. After the test process is completed you will be
prompted to see the results of the test. You can either choose to do
so or skip seeing the results.

If an error occurs, a Warning pop-up warns you that the archiver has
found one or more errors and warnings. Here again you can choose to
view the results of the test process.
