Beezer was originally written for BeOS by me, **Ramshankar**.

The Haiku port was done by **Chris Roberts**.

We now co-develop and maintain Beezer for Haiku.

Beezer was inspired by many other similar programs such as
*Squeezer*, *WinZip*, *FilZip*, *WinRAR* and many more.

Many thanks to **Marcin Konicki** for writing the 7zip add-on,
**Brian Tietz** for the amazing ColumnListView, **YNOP Talton** for
his wonderful SplitPane, **William Kakes** for his sleek URLView and
to **Jeremy Friesner** for *BeShare*'s code which I scavaged a lot &
for actually answering my silly programming questions.

Also thanks to **Miguel Guerreiro** for testing, feedback,
suggestions regarding Rar add-on. Special thanks to **humdinger** for
documentation updates and patches to the some bugs.

I was also constantly inspired by the great guys in *BeShare*. Beezer
would never have been completed without their encouraging words that
kept me going, and for making me realise that people actual find the
program very useful and cool even before its complete :)

Special thanks to all the following *BeShare* members!
