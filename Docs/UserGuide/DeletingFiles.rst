Deleting Files
==============


Select the entries to the deleted, and choose Actions â€“> Delete,
toolbar: Delete or from the :ref:`context menu <ArchiveWindow:Context Menu>`'s
Delete.

If you have chosen a folder to be deleted, then all files inside the
folder will be deleted as well. After you confirm the delete
operation, Beezer starts to delete files from the archive. The
process is shown by a progress bar.

You can cancel a delete operation while it is in progress. But it
will leave the archive in an indeterminate state and you will have to
re-open the archive. Read :ref:`this <AddingFiles:Cancelling the operation>`
note on cancelling such critical operations.

**Tip**: It is always quicker to delete folders if you collapse
(fold) them before deleting.
