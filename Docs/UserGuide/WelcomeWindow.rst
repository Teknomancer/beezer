The four buttons' functions are listed below:

   -  New: Lets you :doc:`create <CreatingArchives>` a new archive
   -  Open: Lets you :doc:`open <ArchiveWindow>` an existing archive
   -  Recent: Allows you to choose one of the most recently used
      archives
   -  Tools: Gives you a list of available tools for Beezer
   -  Preferences: Opens up the :doc:`Preferences`
      window from where you can configure Beezer's settings

Drag 'n Drop

   Apart from the above functions, the Welcome window also provides an
   easy way to open archives. You can drop any archive (or set of
   archives) from *Tracker* and Beezer will try and open them for you.
