Before installing Beezer, make sure its
:doc:`requirements <Requirements>` are met.

Beezer is distributed as a *HPKG* package. You install it like any
other software listed in the HaikuDepot application. That is, find
its entry in the list of packages and click the "Install" button.
Uninstalling is just as easy, just find it in HaikuDepot and click
the "Uninstall" button.

Should you have downloaded the package from some other website,
double-clicking the file will launch it in HaikuDepot and the
installation works as described above.
