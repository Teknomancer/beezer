# Beezer

Beezer is an archiver application for the _Haiku_ operating system (and previously for _Zeta_ and _BeOS_ operating systems).

Beezer is functionally similar to programs like WinZip, Ark (on KDE) and Archive Manager (on Gnome).

Beezer is a native Haiku/BeOS application written from scratch with the aim of having an easy-to-use & responsive GUI while offering powerful archiving features. Under the hood, it controls command-line programs, most of which come pre-installed with the operating system, to seamlessly perform compression and decompression.

Beezer was designed for a pluggable module architecture and supports several popular archive formats such as `zip`, `tar`, `gzip`, `bzip2`, `lha` (`lzh`) and `7zip` using pluggable modules/add-ons. Adding support for more archive formats is thus relatively little work.

**Beezer is currently only being developed/maintained for the Haiku operating system.** The final version available for Zeta and BeOS was version 0.09 and no further updates are planned or available.

Beezer is open source and published under the BSD 3-clause license. Beezer was originally written by Ramshankar (Teknomancer) and after he open sourced it, Chris Roberts (cpr) has ported it to Haiku. Beezer is now being developed by the two of them in their spare time.

Contributions in the form of patches are welcome.

Beezer also supports some additional file formats that may require you to download the binaries if they don't ship as part of the operating system.
